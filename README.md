# DiabDetect-ML-project-2
Name: DiabDetect is an application designed to assist in the detection of diabetes based on various patient features like age, glucose, BMI, etc

Features:
Main Page: Users are greeted with a welcome message

This is an application to perform diabetes prediction. They input patient features such as number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI (Body Mass Index), diabetes pedigree function (DPF), and age.

Machine Learning Model: The application uses a machine learning model (RandomForest Classifier) trained on data to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on the input features.
Prediction Display: After inputting the patient features and clicking the Detect button, the application displays the prediction outcome, indicating whether the person is diabetic or not.
Technologies: The app is built using the Streamlit framework in Python. It leverages libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning model deployment.

Overall, DiabDetect provides users with a user-friendly interface to upload patient data, visualize the data, and obtain predictions regarding diabetes status based on input features.
